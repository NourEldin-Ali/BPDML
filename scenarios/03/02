Upon joining a health and wellness application's fitness challenge, a user is awarded points depending on their daily steps. The point distribution is as follows: 10 points for up to 5,000 steps, 30 points for 5,001 to 10,000 steps, 60 points for 10,001 to 15,000 steps, 100 points for 15,001 to 20,000 steps, and 150 points for exceeding 20,000 steps. Furthermore, if the user records a minimum of 2 liters of daily water intake, they gain an extra 20 points.

Participating in a health and wellness app's fitness challenge, a user accrues points based on their daily steps. The point system is as follows: 10 points for up to 5,000 steps, 30 points for 5,001 to 10,000 steps, 60 points for 10,001 to 15,000 steps, 100 points for 15,001 to 20,000 steps, and 150 points for exceeding 20,000 steps. If the user records a daily water intake of at least 2 liters, they receive an additional bonus of 20 points.

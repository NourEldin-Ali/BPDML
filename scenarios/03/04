An individual signs up for a fitness challenge on a health and wellness app, earning points based on their daily steps. The point structure remains constant: 10 points for up to 5,000 steps, 30 points for 5,001 to 10,000 steps, 60 points for 10,001 to 15,000 steps, 100 points for 15,001 to 20,000 steps, and 150 points for surpassing 20,000 steps. If the user logs at least 2 liters of water intake daily, they receive a bonus of 20 points.

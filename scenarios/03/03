A user registers for a fitness challenge on a health and wellness application, where points are allocated based on their daily steps. The points are distributed as follows: 10 points for up to 5,000 steps, 30 points for 5,001 to 10,000 steps, 60 points for 10,001 to 15,000 steps, 100 points for 15,001 to 20,000 steps, and 150 points for daily steps exceeding 20,000. Additionally, a daily water intake of at least 2 liters earns them an extra 20 points.

A participant enrolls in a fitness challenge through a health and wellness app. They accumulate points based on their daily steps: 10 points for up to 5,000 steps, 30 points for 5,001 to 10,000 steps, 60 points for 10,001 to 15,000 steps, 100 points for 15,001 to 20,000 steps, and 150 points for over 20,000 steps. If they log at least 2 liters of water intake, they receive an additional 20 points.

In this holistic assessment framework, final grades emerge from various elements: Midterm Exam (30%), Final Exam (40%), Assignments (20%), and Participation (10%). Averaging below 50% on exams triggers an automatic failure. Active participation in university-approved extracurricular activities results in an extra 2%. The grading scale remains consistent, encompassing A+ (90% and above), A (85% to 89%), B+ (80% to 84%), B (70% to 79%), C (60% to 69%), D (50% to 59%), to F (Below 50%).

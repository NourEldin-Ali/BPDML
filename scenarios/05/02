In this innovative evaluation approach, final grades are a result of various components such as the Midterm Exam (30%), Final Exam (40%), Assignments (20%), and Participation (10%). Maintaining an average below 50% on exams leads to automatic failure. Students engaged in university-approved extracurricular activities enjoy a 2% bonus. The grading scale maintains its consistency, with A+ (90% and above), A (85% to 89%), B+ (80% to 84%), B (70% to 79%), C (60% to 69%), D (50% to 59%), and F (Below 50%).

Embracing technology, the calculation of final grades integrates components such as the Midterm Exam (30%), Final Exam (40%), Assignments (20%), and Participation (10%). Falling below a 50% average on exams triggers automatic failure. Active participation in university-approved extracurricular activities yields an extra 2%. The grading scale remains steadfast, spanning from A+ (90% and above), A (85% to 89%), B+ (80% to 84%), B (70% to 79%), C (60% to 69%), D (50% to 59%), to F (Below 50%).

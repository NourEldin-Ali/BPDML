In this traditional academic setting, students undergo a comprehensive assessment comprising the Midterm Exam (30%), Final Exam (40%), Assignments (20%), and Participation (10%). Failure is automatic if the average on exams falls below 50%. Those actively participating in university-approved extracurricular activities gain an additional 2%. The grades adhere to the consistent scale, ranging from A+ (90% and above), A (85% to 89%), B+ (80% to 84%), B (70% to 79%), C (60% to 69%), D (50% to 59%), to F (Below 50%).

In a progressive pedagogical approach, the computation of final grades incorporates diverse elements: Midterm Exam (30%), Final Exam (40%), Assignments (20%), and Participation (10%). Falling below 50% on exam averages results in automatic failure. Engaging in university-approved extracurricular activities grants an additional 2%. The grading scale follows a consistent pattern, encompassing A+ (90% and above), A (85% to 89%), B+ (80% to 84%), B (70% to 79%), C (60% to 69%), D (50% to 59%), and F (Below 50%).

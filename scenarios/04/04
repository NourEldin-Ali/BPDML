In our annual bonus determination, employees rated 1 or 2 won't receive a bonus. A rating of 3 corresponds to a 2% bonus, while a rating of 4 equates to a 5% bonus, and a rating of 5 leads to a 10% bonus. Employees with over 10 years of service will receive an extra 1% bonus. It's crucial to note that our bonus distribution is capped at $1,000,000. If the calculated bonuses exceed this cap, adjustments will be made proportionately to maintain fiscal responsibility.

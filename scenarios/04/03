As part of our annual bonus calculation, employees rated 1 or 2 won't receive a bonus. Those with a rating of 3 will receive a 2% bonus, while a rating of 4 warrants a 5% bonus, and a rating of 5 results in a 10% bonus. Employees exceeding 10 years of service will additionally receive a 1% bonus. However, we maintain a maximum bonus pool of $1,000,000. If the calculated bonuses surpass this limit, adjustments will be made proportionately to ensure fairness and budget adherence.

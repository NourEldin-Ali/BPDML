As part of our annual bonus allocation, employees rated 1 or 2 will not receive any bonus. A rating of 3 entitles an employee to a 2% bonus, while a rating of 4 results in a 5% bonus, and a rating of 5 leads to a 10% bonus. Employees with over 10 years of service will receive an additional 1% bonus. Please be aware that our bonus pool is capped at $1,000,000. Should the total calculated bonuses exceed this amount, adjustments will be applied proportionately to align with our budgetary constraints.

As part of our annual bonus calculation, employees with a rating of 1 or 2 will not receive any bonus. Those with a rating of 3 will receive a 2% bonus, while a rating of 4 results in a 5% bonus, and a rating of 5 leads to a 10% bonus. Employees with over 10 years of service will receive an additional 1% bonus. However, please note that the total bonus pool must not exceed $1,000,000. If the calculated bonuses surpass this limit, all bonuses will be adjusted proportionately to fit within the budget.

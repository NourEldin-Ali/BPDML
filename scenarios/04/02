In our annual bonus distribution, employees rated 1 or 2 will not receive a bonus. Those with a rating of 3 will enjoy a 2% bonus, while a rating of 4 earns a 5% bonus, and a rating of 5 results in a 10% bonus. Additionally, employees with more than 10 years of service will receive an extra 1% bonus. It's important to note that we maintain a strict bonus cap of $1,000,000. If the calculated bonuses exceed this limit, adjustments will be made proportionately to ensure compliance with the budget.
